"""Continuous translation of a locked region, by local OCR then translation.

The second live engine.  Where :mod:`mage.live_lens` asks one vision model to
detect, read and translate together, this reads locally with PP-OCRv5 and sends
only text to the network.

That split is what buys the architecture its speed, and not in the obvious way.
Reading is not much cheaper than grounding was; what changes is *how often the
network is called*.  A perceptual hash can only ask whether the pixels moved,
and in a game they move constantly — particle effects, an animated HUD, a
scrolling combat log — while the dialogue sits still.  With text in hand the
question becomes whether the *text* moved, and the expensive half fires on a
small fraction of ticks instead of all of them.  A repeated line costs nothing
at all, because the cache has it.

Everything around the call — the tick, the phash pre-gate, the carry, the
masking, the painting — is inherited from :class:`mage.live_common.LiveWorkerBase`.
