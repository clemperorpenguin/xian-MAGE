"""Line translation through Hy-MT2.

The OCR pipeline's other half.  Once a local reader supplies text and boxes,
the network is only asked to translate — no geometry, no JSON schema, no
instruction-following — which is a far lower bar and is why a 1.8B model is
enough for it.

Hy-MT2 is a machine-translation model with its own published instruction
formats, and it gets those verbatim rather than something improvised.  Three of
them are used here:

* **Default** — target language, and an explicit "only output the translated
  result", because anything else it says lands on the screen as a translation.
* **Terminology** — reference pairs before the request, which is how a glossary
  reaches an MT model.  MAGE's wiki glossary is keyed by the source-language
  name and valued by the canonical target-language one, which is exactly the
  shape this template wants.
* **Style** — used when the user has configured a translation style.

The source language is deliberately *not* named: the published default format
does not carry one, and the model detects it.

Everything goes in a single user turn.  There is no system prompt, because an
MT model translates instructions rather than following them.
